## Introduction

The Simon Game is a popular memory game where the player must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors. The game starts with one color, and each round adds a new color to the sequence. The player loses if they press the wrong color.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Real-time feedback with animations and sounds.
- Incremental difficulty as the game progresses.
- Game-over state with a restart option.

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subhamsam007/Simon-Game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Simon-Game
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Follow the sequence of colors displayed by the game.
3. Click on the buttons to repeat the sequence in the correct order.
4. If you make a mistake, the game will display "Game Over, Press Any Key to Restart" and you can start over by pressing any key.

## Code Explanation

### Variables

- `buttonColours`: An array containing the colors used in the game.
- `gamePattern`: The sequence of colors generated by the game.
- `userClickedPattern`: The sequence of colors clicked by the user.
- `started`: A boolean to check if the game has started.
- `level`: Tracks the current level of the game.

### Functions

- **`nextSequence()`**: Generates the next color in the sequence, updates the level, and displays the sequence.
- **`checkAnswer(currentLevel)`**: Checks the user's answer against the game sequence. If correct, it progresses to the next level. If incorrect, it triggers the game-over state.
- **`playSound(name)`**: Plays the sound associated with a given color.
- **`animatePress(currentColor)`**: Adds and removes the "pressed" animation to a button.
- **`startOver()`**: Resets the game variables to restart the game.

### Event Listeners

- **`$(document).keypress`**: Starts the game on any key press.
- **`$(".btn").click`**: Handles the button clicks by the user, updating the user pattern and checking the answer.
